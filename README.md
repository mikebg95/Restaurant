The app downloads an API which contains certain restaurant dishes (each with characteristics like 'category', 'name', 'description', 'price' etc.).
The different categories are shown on the homescreen; when clicked on one of these categories the app shows a list of dishes that fit that category.
When clicked on a specific dish, a new screen opens which shows the details of that dish (picture, name, description and price).
